Dear Dr. Brown-Guedira,\cb1 \
\
\cb3 My name is Nicolas Lara; I am currently a research assistant in Dr. Michel's composting and bioprocessing lab at the Ohio State University and will be applying to PhD programs in the fall. \
\
I have been very interested in plant breeding since I worked in Dr. David Francis\'92s tomato breeding lab at OSU several years ago.  I am especially interested in using genetic and computational tools to improve trait selection. To that end, I have read several of your papers; I found your recent paper \'93\cf4 \cb3 Training population selection and use of fixed effects to optimize genomic predictions in a historical USA winter wheat panel\'94 to be especially interesting. The ability to add that much extra power to trait selection in smaller populations is amazing, and seems to me to increase accessibility of genetically informed breeding to smaller and less financially well-off growers.\cf2 \cb3 \

I am writing to you now because I\'92m going to be visiting some family in Raleigh on Monday, July 23rd. I know this is short notice, but I would love to meet with you and discuss your research if you have any time.\
\
Best,\
\
Nicolas\
